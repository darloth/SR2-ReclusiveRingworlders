ORB_EXP_PLATFORM: Exploitation Platform
ORB_EXP_PLATFORM_DESC: <<
	This gargantuan orbital structure is filled with robots, convicts, or virtual labor, and uses them to ruthlessly exploit the resource base of whatever planet it is orbiting.

	This permanently damages the planet, but makes its resource immediately available for export, and also generates ore for the orbiting platform.
